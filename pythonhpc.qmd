title: High-performance Python
description: |
  In scientific computing, Python is the most popular programming/scripting language. While known for its
  high-level features, hundreds of fantastic libraries and ease of use, Python is slow compared to traditional
  (C, C++, Fortran) and new (Julia, Chapel) compiled languages. In this course we'll focus on speeding up your
  Python workflows using a number of different approaches. In Part 1 we will start with traditional
  vectorization with NumPy, will talk about Python compilers (Numba) and profiling and will cover
  parallelization. We'll do a little bit of multithreading (possible via numexpr, despite the global
  interpreter lock) but will target primarily multiprocessing.
  
  In Part 2 we will study Ray, a unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications. Since this is not a
  machine learning workshop, we will not touch most of Ray's AI capabilities, but will focus on its core
  distributed runtime and data libraries. We will learn several different approaches to parallelizing purely
  numerical (and therefore CPU-bound) workflows, both with and without reduction. If your code is I/O-bound,
  you will also benefit from this course, as I/O-bound workflows can be easily processed with Ray.

**Date:** \
Friday, June 7, 2024

**Time:** \
9:30pmâ€“4:30pm with a one-hour lunch break (12:30pm-1:30pm)

**Instructor:** \
Alex Razoumov (Simon Fraser University)

**Prerequisites:** \
Some knowledge of basic Python, numpy, and working with the Slurm scheduler.

**Software:** \
We will provide access to one of our Linux systems. To make use of it, attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer. On Windows we recommend the [free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers, SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
